ABOUT

	Millions of copies had been sold and the game become a hit.
	However, there is a Bug that resides in the game causing Players cannot log out.

	In 2010, The World is closed after The Twilight Incident occured.
	Humans are now in era of Eithernet, where PROGRAM and human lives together in harmony.
	However, unknown to society eyes, The World's history is not over...

GAMEPLAY

	There are numerous enhancements done to this game which no longer "normal RPG Maker Game" such as:

	1. Battlers are animated when they attack to enhance the immersion.

	2. Multiple worlds in which characters move one into the others.
		a. Normal World - world where humans resides
		b. Eithernet	- world where PROGRAM (ex: Mega.exe) resides
		c. The World	- world from .hack//games
	3. Custom Upgrade system, in this game no longer have normal EXP and Level.
	   The characters status are open to Player, in which area need improvements.

	4. Also Custom Skill system, there are 5 "Class" in this game (RPGMaker 2000 had no class system, unlike RPGMaker 2003):
	   a. Emerald 	- Elemental
	   b. Onyx	- Darkness
	   c. Diamond	- Hacking
	   d. Pearl	- Holy
	   e. Saphire	- Distrust
	   Who will have which class and how the skills grown is all up to Player's will.

	5. Expanded Battle System, in this game special enemies have more than 9999 HP (Max HP in RPGMaker).
	   Ultimate Skills are upgraded in these special battles to be able to defeat enemies which have million HP.
